ticks_info=How often will the circuit network will be read.\nHigher values improve performance, at the cost of being slower to respond to changes in circuit values.\nThe default of 1 should be fine unless this __1__ is monitoring hundreds of signals.
enabled=Enable/disable this __1__.
separate=If __1__ (the default) signals found on both the red and green wire are merged into a single value.\nIf __2__, the red and green wires are graphed separately, with a coloured border on the icon indicating which wire the signal was on.\nNote that monitoring the red and green wires separately can impact performance when a lot of signals are being graphed.
allow_neg=The __4__ UI cannot display positive and negative values in a single graph.\nIf set to __1__ (the default) negative values will be ignored (set to 0).\nIf set to __2__, negative values will be graphed separately, under the "__3__" side of the __4__ UI.\nThis is primarily useful for values which will always be negative. Signals that go from positive to negative and back will appear across two graphs, which may be harder to read.
