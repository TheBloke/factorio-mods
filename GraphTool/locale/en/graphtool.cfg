separate=Record red/green signals separately?
allow_neg=Allow negative values?
On=On
Off=Off
Yes=Yes
No=No

[tooltip]
ticks_info=How often will the circuit network will be read.\nHigher values improve performance, at the cost of being slower to respond to changes in circuit values.\nThe default of 1 should be fine in most games.
enabled=Enable/disable graphing
separate=By default, the red and green networks are merged into a single graph value per signal.\nAlternatively, the red and green network can be graphed separately.\nNote that recording separate red/green values will impact on performance.
allow_neg=The power graph cannot display negative values in a single graph. By default, negative values will be changed to 0. If "Allow Negative" is enabled, these negative values will instead be graphed separately on the "Production" side of the power graph.
